    "information": "Hello, I am Barış DEMİRCİ (a.k.a. barbarbar338). Thanks for visiting my page!\nI live in Turkey and am someone who spends most of my time playing games, listening to songs and coding. I have been in coding since 2010 and I started my career first by making simple websites. Then I proceeded to become a game developer. But right now I'm more interested in TypeScript (JavaScript) because it is both the most enjoyable language and a mandatory language that all developers should know.\nSince 2010 I have created many games and many simple websites for my customers but I have continued to work for more back-end projects since 2017. My focus right now is to create lots of open source projects. It makes me very happy that my knowledge helps other people. That's why I also have a small YouTube channel (you can find this channel in the \"Contact\" section). I am posting coding tutorials on this channel.\nI said I loved open source projects, don't forget to follow my GitHub profile (you can find it in the \"Contact\" section) for the codes of this site and more open source projects!"
